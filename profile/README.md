## THE GÖDE GROUP
The GÖDE Group consists of numerous companies that can all be traced back to the special astrophilatelistic mail order company founded in 1978. Back then, Dr Michael Göde laid the foundations for today's GÖDE Group in a garden house. With a total of eight global locations, numerous different brands and a powerful international network, business divisions encompass collectibles and coins, services, the establishment of new business divisions and external business participations.
